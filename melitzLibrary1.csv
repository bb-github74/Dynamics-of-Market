Under some parameter restrictions, the trade elasticity is constant and is a sufficient statistic for welfare, along with the domestic trade share. However, even small deviations from these restrictions imply that trade elasticities are variable and differ across markets and levels of trade costs. In this more general setting, the domestic trade share and endogenous trade elasticity are no longer sufficient statistics for welfare. Additional empirically observable moments of the micro structure also matter for welfare."

For computable general equilibrium (CGE) modelers, the book shows how Melitz-style CGE models can be calibrated, solved and interpreted.  A major practical contribution of the book is to show how large-scale Armington models such as GTAP can be converted to Melitz by the addition of a small number of equations and minimal alteration of the original Armington model.   The book describes computational experience in solving Melitz CGE models using GEMPACK software.  This experience will be of interest to researchers currently attempting to solve Melitz-based CGE models. Almost all previous Melitz studies have used GAMS software.  Authors of these studies have reported computational difficulties.  These difficulties did not occur in this book’s GEMPACK-based computations.  The book concludes that: (a) CGE modelers can embrace Melitz while retaining their Armington-based models as powerful interpretive devices; and (b) via GEMPACK, large-scale CGE models incorporating Melitz specifications can be solved with no more difficulty than similar-dimensioned Armington models.  ."

Economic expansions induce higher entry rates by prospective entrants subject to sunk investment costs. The sluggish response of the number of producers generates a new and potentially important endogenous propagation mechanism for business cycle models. The return to investment determines household saving decisions, producer entry, and the allocation of labor across sectors. Our framework replicates several features of business cycles and predicts procyclical profits even for preference specifications that imply countercyclical markups."

International differences in labor market regulations affect how firms can adjust to idiosyncratic shocks. These institutional differences interact with sector specific differences in volatility (the variance of the firm-specific shocks in a sector) to generate a new source of comparative advantage. Other things equal, countries with more flexible labor markets specialize in sectors with higher volatility. Empirical evidence for a large sample of countries strongly supports this theory: the exports of countries with more flexible labor markets are biased towards high-volatility sectors.

alma9946925742604105,,Market Penetration Costs and the New Consumers Margin in International Trade,"Arkolakis, Costas.",2008,,,,,,,National Bureau of Economic Research,"Cambridge, Mass","I develop a new theory of marketing costs and introduce it into a model of trade with product differentiation and firm productivity heterogeneity. In this model, a firm enters a market if it makes profits by reaching a single consumer there and pays an increasing marginal cost to access additional consumers. This market penetration cost introduces an extensive margin of new consumers in firms' sales.  I calibrate the key parameters of the model to match data on French firms from Eaton, Kortum and Kramarz, in particular the higher sales in France of firms that choose to export to more destinations.  The model predicts that most firms do not export, and that a large proportion of firms that export in particular markets do so in small amounts.  These predictions are in line with the French data, but together create a puzzle for models with a fixed cost of exporting, such as those of Melitz and Chaney. Looking at the comparative statics of trade liberalization, I find that the model predicts large increases in trade in goods with positive but little previous trade, in line with Kehoe and Ruhl. The model implies that these increases can contribute to new trade significantly more than the corresponding increases due to new exporters."
alma9946925878604105,,Improved Access to Foreign Markets Raises Plant-Level Productivity ... for Some Plants,"Lileeva, Alla. and Trefler, Daniel.",2007,,,,,,,National Bureau of Economic Research,"Cambridge, Mass","We weigh into the debate about whether rising productivity is ever a consequence rather than a cause of exporting. Exporting and investing to raise productivity are complimentary activities. For lower-productivity firms, incurring the fixed costs of such investments is justifiable only if accompanied by the larger sales volumes that come with exporting. Lower foreign tariffs will induce these firms to simultaneously export and invest in productivity. In contrast, lower foreign tariffs will induce higher-productivity firms to export without investing, as in Melitz (2003). We model this econometrically using a heterogeneous response model. Unique 'plant-specific' tariff cuts serve as our instrument for the decision of Canadian plants to start exporting to the United States. We find that those lower-productivity Canadian plants that were induced by the tariff cuts to start exporting (a) increased their labor productivity, (b) engaged in more product innovation, and (c) had high adoption rates of advanced manufacturing technologies.  These new exporters also increased their domestic (Canadian) market share at the expense of non-exporters, which suggests that the labor productivity gains reflect underlying gains in TFP. In contrast, we find no effects for higher-productivity plants, just as predicted by our complementarity theory."

First, we show that the most productive U.S. firms invest in a larger number of foreign countries and sell more in each country in which they operate. Second, we assess the importance of firm heterogeneity in the structure of MNE activity. Third, we use the model to identify the mechanisms through which country characteristics affect the structure of MNE activity. Finally, we provide a systematic assessment of the model's shortcomings in order to inform the development of new theory."

This allows for consideration of (a) trade growth in new varieties; (b) aggregate productivity changes attributed to reallocation of resources across and within an industry; and (c) productivity growth in manufacturing due to increased access to business services. The results indicate relatively small gains for the EU, whereas Ukraine benefits with a welfare increase of over 8%. The deindustrialization impact, previously found by Olekseyuk and Balistreri ( 2014 ) in a comparison of different modeling structures, is supported by our findings. Ukraine's welfare gains are higher under an Armington structure compared to monopolistic competition. This is due to a movement of resources into Ukraine's traditional export sectors producing under constant returns. Implementation of the FDI modeling approach and liberalization of barriers to FDI, however, mitigates the deindustrialization impact as multinational firms enter the Ukrainian market. This increases the number of available varieties and, consequently, induces productivity growth of manufacturing sectors due to improved access to business services as critical inputs."

First, I challenge the view that arbitrage between gold and silver in European trade with China was important except for one twenty-year spell. Next, I argue that had China imported gold, its history would have been much the same. I also dispute the idea that the persistence of the silver inflows from 1550 to 1820 implies any persistent disequilibrium, and I maintain that economic theory can easily accommodate the view that the inflow of silver into China sponsored growth in China."

Rather it comes through the promotion of the tradability of goods, capital in particular: specifically, the encouragement of price competition, contestable home markets, ability to borrow and buy insurance at home, and the harmonization of regulations. Some of the consumption smoothing may also depend on EU membership rather than EMU as such but EMU adds to it. As a fundamental part of the analysis, the paper uses a new index of currency union which focuses on the ratio of trade with other countries sharing the same currency relative to total foreign trade."

C","In the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), trade liberalization measures have coincided with stable economic growth, and GDP per capita growth has surpassed that of other developing regions. However, MENA's labor-market outcomes--such as average wage levels, informality rate, and female labor force participation--continue to underperform. Why has rising trade failed to produce better labor market outcomes in low- and middle-income countries in the region? 'Exports to Improve Labor Markets in the Middle East and North Africa' focuses on the impact of trade policy on trade-flows and their relationship with local labor market outcomes in three low- and middle-income countries--the Arab Republic of Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia. Given their idiosyncratic labor markets, export diversification, and trade policy history, these three countries other important lessons for economic development in the region. Policy makers and stakeholders can use these findings to design policies to improve the chances that higher trade flows will deliver better labor market outcomes and ensure that the benefits are more equally shared. 'This report, led by Gladys Lopez-Acevedo and Raymond Robertson, pushes forward the frontier of knowledge about the relationship between trade and the labor market in MENA. Although focusing on three countries (the Arab Republic of Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia), it gives us broader lessons on how to solve the apparent puzzle of greater exposure to trade not being followed by greater labor market outcomes in the region. It points out, among other factors, how market segmentation by gender shapes the effects of trade shocks like higher exports. Policy makers in the region will definitely benefit from the evidence and analysis conveyed by the report on how to turn trade integration into a lever for shared prosperity.' --Otaviano Canuto, Senior Fellow at the Policy Center for the New South, and former Vice President of the World Bank 'This timely report attempts to understand why trade expansion did not produce the desired improvements in labor market outcomes in three non-oil-exporting countries in MENA. The main reason for the weak link between trade expansion and widely shared labor market improvements appears to be the segmented nature of labor markets in the three countries, by gender as well as by formality status. In Morocco and Tunisia, the highly segmented labor markets along gender lines, in combination with the concentration of trade in male-dominated capital-intensive sectors, led to few employment benefits accruing to women. In Egypt, the limited impact of trade on formal employment is attributable to the small size of the nation's export sector and its lack of integration with the rest of the economy. These findings are critical to understanding how barriers to widely shared prosperity can be tackled in the region.' --Ragui Assaad, Professor, Humphrey School of Public Affairs, University of Minnesota."

Based on price level evidence, this paper shows for the first time that the wealth effect of the Black Death on economic activity continued in England for generations, up to 1450. Indeed, in the absence of consideration of the wealth effect, other influences on the price level do not even appear in the econometric analysis. The shift in tastes toward higher quality goods, luxuries and imports stemming from the per capita windfall for the survivors in the mid-fourteenth century plays a substantial part in the analysis. So does England’s little influence on the relative prices of its imports relative to home goods. The separate effects of coinage, population, trade, wages and annual number of days worked for wages on the price level all also receive major attention and new results follow for adjustment in the labor market."

Firms' monopoly power on product markets leads to strategic wage bargaining. Solving for the symmetric equilibrium we show that the selection effect of trade influences labor market outcomes. Trade liberalization lowers unemployment and raises real wages as long as it improves average productivity. We show that this condition is likely to be met by a reduction in variable trade costs or by entry of new trading countries. Calibrating the model shows that the long-run impact of trade openness on the rate of unemployment is negative and quantitatively significant.
BaldwinRichardE.2008Tagw,,Trade and growth with heterogeneous firms,"Baldwin, Richard E. and Robert-Nicoud, Frédéric",2008,Journal of international economics,74,1,21-34,,,Elsevier B.V,AMSTERDAM,"This paper explores the impact of trade on growth when firms are heterogeneous. We find that greater openness produces anti- and pro-growth effects. The Hopenhayn–Melitz-model selection effects raises the expected cost of introducing a new variety and this tends to slow the rate of new-variety introduction and hence growth. The pro-growth effect stems from the impact that freer trade has on the marginal cost of innovating. The balance of the two effects is ambiguous with the sign depending upon the exact nature of the innovation technology and its connection to international trade in goods and ideas. We consider five special cases (these include the Grossman–Helpman, the Coe–Helpman, and the Rivera–Batiz–Romer models) two of which suggest that trade harms growth; the others predicting the opposite."

The modern international trade workhorse models (e.g. Melitz, 2003) assume heterogeneous productivity and, implicitly, predict that the ex-post largest exporters in a new product would be the pioneers, since they can pay back exploration costs. However, using detailed data on the early dynamics of new exports in Chile (1990–2007) we show that, on average, pioneers export less than comparable followers in the same new product. Moreover, followers are 40% more likely to enter a product if a pioneer survives more than one year exporting. These facts are consistent with pioneer-to-follower spillovers, or at least with stories in which the cost of entering early is disproportionally higher for larger exporters. Otherwise they would enter first. Firms better at “exploration” could be worse at “exploitation” (scale-up) in a new export product. This phenomenon is scarce, though, since in most new products pioneers are not followed, even if they survive. •Melitz (2003) implicitly predicts that the largest exporters would pioneer new export products.•Chilean data shows pioneers export less than comparable followers in new products.•Most pioneers do not have followers, though, even if they survive."

As they are upper right-tail phenomena, this paper shows that assuming asymptotic power functions for various model primitives (such as demand and firm heterogeneity) are sufficient for matching these regularities. This greatly relaxes the functional-form restrictions in economic modeling and can be beneficial in certain contexts. We demonstrate this in a modified Melitz (2003) model which embeds an innovation mechanism in order to endogenize the productivity distribution and generate both of the above-mentioned power laws. We also investigate the model's welfare implications with regard to innovation by conducting a quantitative analysis of the welfare gains from trade."

Research Design & Methods: Our analytical framework refers to the most recent strand in the new trade theory literature based on the Melitz (2003) model that stresses the role of firm heterogeneity and the importance of firm productivity in entering export markets. We treat innovations as a key element that can increase the level of productivity and study the significance of both product and process innovations. The empirical implementation of the theoretical framework is based on the probit model and the unique Polish CIS firm-level dataset covering the period 2008-2010. Findings: Our estimation results indicate that the probability of exporting is positively related to product and process innovations, firm size, the share of university graduates in productive employment and foreign capital participation. The results depend also on the level of technology used in the analysed sector and the relative importance of export market.Implications & Recommendations: It is necessary to develop an innovation supporting mechanism that would stimulate both product and process innovations in Poland. Contribution & Value Added: The originality of this work lies in the use of the unique Polish CIS firm level dataset that allows distinguishing between product and process innovations."

The empirical implementation of the theoretical framework is based on the probit model and the BEEPS data set. Our empirical results confirm the importance of firm characteristics for export performance in the CEE countries. Also heterogeneity between different country groups within the region has been reported. Export competitiveness of firms from the CEE countries can be improved through the development of modern educational systems allowing to accelerate the accumulation of human capital. The financial support to research and development and innovation activities should also have a positive impact on the export performance of firms from the CEE countries. We take into account labor productivity and other firm characteristics that may affect export performance such as the age and the size of the firm, the use of human capital, and the degree of firm internationalization."

In contrast to the existing literature, we investigate whether the adoption of the common currency increases the export activity of individual firms. In particular, we refer to the new strand in the trade theory literature, based on the Melitz (2003) model, in which export performance depends on labor productivity and costs of exporting. There are already many empirical studies, based on firm level data, showing the relevance of the Melitz (2003) model. Most of those studies demonstrate that export performance positively depends on firms’ characteristics such as labor productivity, spending on R&D, age of the firm, the stock of human capital or propensity to innovate, but they do not take into account the impact of the common currency on the cost of exporting. There are only few studies analyzing trade implications of euro adoption for firms’ exports of “old EU” members. In our empirical paper we use the firm level data basis set up by the EBRD and the World Bank for Central and Eastern European Countries. Using the probit model, we analyze whether the accession of Slovenia and Slovakia to the Eurozone did increase the firms’ propensity to export in those countries."
LawlessMartina2013MDDE,,Marginal Distance: Does Export Experience Reduce Firm Trade Costs?,"Lawless, Martina",2013,Open economies review,24,5,819-841,,,Springer US,Boston,"Are the costs of exporting to a market reduced if a firm has experience of exporting to a neighbouring market? If so, does this effect operate through reducing entry barriers or by increasing sales once the firm is operating in the market? This paper examines linkages between current export destinations and entry, sales and exit for new markets. We find that measures of exporting experience in geographically nearby markets increase the probability of entry into a market and reduce the probability of exit. However, these same measures have very limited effect on the firm’s export sales in the market. The effect of related experience on sales tends to be negative for recently entered firms. We interpret this result in the context of the Melitz heterogeneous-firm model of trade by showing that lower fixed costs reduce the entry threshold, but this lower threshold has the effect of allowing lower-sales marginal firms to be present in the market."

We show that opening up to trade generally leads to a steeper optimal managerial incentive scheme (and hence, higher firm productivity) via a new mechanism by which selection of heterogeneous firms into the export market plays a key role. This is because trade openness unambiguously increases the variation of firm profits by reallocating profits towards ex post low-cost exporters, leading to a higher stake of the market game faced by the principals. Interestingly, it is further shown that, whilst falling variable trade costs unambiguously increase managerial incentives, a reduction in fixed trade costs could possibly lead to weaker incentives and thus generate productivity losses due to an adverse inter-firm reallocation effect. Hence, the model establishes a causal link between the Melitz-type reallocation effect and the within-firm productivity changes, both of which have been identified as important sources of aggregate productivity gains from trade by recent empirical studies."

Our results show that firms with a broader investment strategy, reflecting a great importance of market-driven motives, show higher productivity levels than firms with less encompassing foreign investment strategies. We conclude that the methodology is well-suited to sort firms according to the importance of market-driven FDI."

Based on an in-depth analysis of global trade characteristics, a summary of existing problems, and a comparative analysis of various prediction methods, this paper constructs the ARIMA model, BP neural network (BPNN) model, and deep neural network (DNN) model to make a comprehensive comparison of international trade quantification. The results show that the nonlinear model has a global trade quantification has some advantages over linear models, and the deep model shows better prediction performance than the shallow model. In addition, preprocessing of the time series is considered to improve the prediction accuracy or shorten the model training time. The empirical modal analysis method (EMD) is introduced to decompose the time series into eigenmodal functions (IMFs) of different scales. Then the decomposed IMF series are arranged into a matrix using principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality and extract the data containing the most stock index information features; these features are then input into BPNN and DNN for combined prediction, thus constructing the combined models EMD-PCA-BPNN and EMD-PCA-DNN. Based on Melitz’s heterogeneous firm trade theory and its development by Chaney, a quantitative trade model incorporating production heterogeneity is constructed through a multisector extension. This paper adopts a general equilibrium analysis, which makes the modeling process pulse clear. The completed model has high flexibility and scalability, which can be applied to quantitative analysis of various problems."

Secondly, to understand the determinants of export performance in a sample of exporting firms from Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. The main emphasis in this part of the analysis will be on various dimensions of the business environment in which firms operate such as the degree of competition from informal activity, prevalence of corruption and the general efficiency of the logistics industry in the economy. The study uses data provided by the Interim Enterprise Survey conducted in 2009-10. Estimation is done in three stages—first on the sample of Pakistani firms, then the pooled sample (containing firms from India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka) and finally the pooled sub-sample (containing Indian and Sri Lankan firms only). Results reveal that for the pooled sample, the impact of the crisis on export growth becomes insignificant by 2011 which could possibly suggest that firms have recovered from the impact of the crisis by the time these firms were interviewed for the Interim Survey data collection in 2010. On the other hand for Pakistan, crisis continues to have a significant negative impact on expected export growth even after two years since the onset of the crisis—suggesting that financial markets in Pakistan are more underdeveloped relative to comparator countries of South Asia. In addition size is consistently found to be an important determinant of export growth for Pakistani firms. This implies that government policies aimed at promoting organic growth of small firms may be useful in increasing future export growth."
LindicMojca2015HTFU,,HOW TRADING FIRMS UPGRADE SKILLS AND TECHNOLOGY: THEORETICAL MODEL,"Lindic, Mojca",2015,Economic and business review for Central and South-Eastern Europe,17,3,347-369,,,"University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Economics",Ljubljana,"This paper studies the mechanisms of skill upgrading in trading firms by developing a theoretical model that relates the individual's incentives for acquiring higher skills to the profit-maximizing behaviour of trading firms. The model shows that only the high ability individuals have incentives for acquiring higher skills, as long as they are compensated with higher wages after entering employment. Furthermore, high-productive firms have incentives for investing in higher technology, to employ high-skilled labour, and to engage in international trade. The decisions for technology dress-up and skill upgrading coincide with firm's decisions to start importing and exporting as the latter requires higher technology and high-skilled labour. Contributions of the paper are twofold: gaining new insights by combining fragments of models on individual's and firm's behaviours, and broadening the content of the Melitz (2003) model by introducing importers and controlling for skilled and unskilled labour."
